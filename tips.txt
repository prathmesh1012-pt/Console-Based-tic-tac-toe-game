Go for the Center: The center square is the most important one. If you can, take the center square on your first turn.

Block Your Opponent: Always watch what your opponent is doing. If they have two marks in a row, you must place your mark in the third square to block them.

Create Two Threats: Try to set up a situation where you can win on two different lines. This makes it impossible for your opponent to block you.
